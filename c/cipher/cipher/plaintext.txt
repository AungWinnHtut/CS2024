Myanmar,[d] officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar,
[e] also known as Burma (the official name until 1989), 
is a country in Southeast Asia. It is the largest country 
by area in Mainland Southeast Asia, 
and had a population of about 54 million in 2017.
[11] It is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, 
China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, 
and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest. 
The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon (formerly Rangoon).[2]

Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking 
Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar.
[12] In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, 
and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, 
the Burmese language, culture, and Theravada Buddhism slowly became 
dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, 
and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, 
the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period.[13] 
The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar 
and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British East India Company seized
 control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century,
 and the country became a British colony. After a brief Japanese occupation, 
Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies. On 4 January 1948, Myanmar declared independence under 
the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947
